# JSON YAML Conversion

## Usage

./yaml2json.py --yaml from.yaml --json to.json

./json2yaml.py --json from.json --yaml to.yaml


## Notes

Going from JSON to YAML and back again won't leave you with the same file (you won't be able to use diff to compare them for example) because ordering will not be preserved. However, the resulting JSON should be functionally the same - i.e. it will load into CloudFormation successfully, generating the same stack as would have been generated by the original file.

json2yaml.py was taken from https://gist.github.com/vishnu21/c7a8211a744b25f3c3eabba74429d9ff#file-converter-py (see http://blog.flux7.com/how-to-convert-a-cloudformation-template-from-json-to-yaml).
